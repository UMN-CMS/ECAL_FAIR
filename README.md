# ECAL_FAIR
A repository for development of ECAL laser performance studies with the FAIR project

The main component is to run the 'pipeline.ipynb' notebook in the notebooks folder. It loads a dataframe currently sitting in /scripts which contains data for a single ECAL crystal for the year of 2018

The notebook is designed to be run in the MSI notebook interactive environment on the k40 GPU cluster. It runs with the Python 3.7 kernel.
