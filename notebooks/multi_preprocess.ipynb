    "This is the notebook to build the data processing pipeline to feed into the GRU network. It starts with a slimmed and skimmed csv file with p2_calib being the value to predict, and int_deliv_inv_ub and calib_time being the best values to use. It's important to note that at this point, some of the lumi measurements are taken a bit far from the calibration times. this can be seen by the difference between the lumi-section time and the calib_time values. The best data probably just consistents of the points where these are close.\n",
